Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Atheon AI architecture diagram.
An actual diagram should be created using a tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid and saved as architecture.png in this directory.

The diagram should include:

1. Orchestrator (Vertical Agent)
2. Specialized Agents (Horizontal Agents):
   - Scraper Agent (Go)
   - Data Fetcher Agent (Rust)
   - Summarizer Agent (Python)
   - Transcription Agent (Python)
3. Frontend (Next.js)
4. Infrastructure Components:
   - Kafka
   - PostgreSQL
   - Redis
   - Prometheus/Grafana
5. Communication flows between components
6. Human-in-the-loop integration
7. Kubernetes deployment architecture

The diagram should be clear, visually appealing, and easy to understand for new contributors to the project.
