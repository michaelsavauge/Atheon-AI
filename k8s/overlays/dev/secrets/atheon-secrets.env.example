# Atheon AI Development Secrets Example
# This file serves as documentation of required secrets.
# Even in development, secrets should be managed using Doppler.
#
# To use with Doppler CLI: doppler run -- kubectl apply -k .
#
# The following variables should be configured in your Doppler project:

# Database Connection
# DATABASE_URL

# Authentication
# JWT_SECRET_KEY (used as JWT_SECRET in application)
# JWT_ALGORITHM
# JWT_REFRESH_SECRET

# API Keys for LLM Services
# OPENAI_API_KEY
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
# HUMANLAYER_API_KEY
# HUMANLAYER_PROJECT_ID

# Development Settings
# LOG_LEVEL=debug
# API_DEBUG=true

# IMPORTANT: Never commit actual secrets to Git - use Doppler for all environments.
